Executive Summary
President Talon, who was re-elected in April 2021 following elections that were contested by the
opposition, will remain in power until 2026. This gives him the opportunity to continue
implementing the reforms he began in 2016. However, Benin’s democratic system has become
fragile, due to reforms to the party system and the new electoral code adopted in 2018. The country
experienced deadly electoral violence in 2019 and 2021. Following the recent elections in January
2023, the opposition party Les Démocrates, led by Boni Yayi, Talon’s predecessor, holds 28 seats
in parliament, replacing the previous mono-colored Bloc Républicain (BR) and the Union
Progressiste (UP) parliament (2019 – 2023). This shift provides the opposition with a platform for
criticizing Talon’s dictatorial tendencies and exercising control over government actions. The new
parliament demonstrates progress in gender representation, with women occupying 26.60% of the
seats, a notable increase from less than 10% in all Benin’s parliaments since 1990. However, voter
turnout has significantly declined since 2019, indicating apathy and a lack of confidence in the
government, institutions and political processes.
The government’s Action Program (PAG) implemented between 2016 and 2021 has yielded
visible effects, particularly in infrastructure development, modernization of administrative
services and urban living environment improvements through the paving project. A new PAG for
the period from 2016 to 2021 aims to build upon the previous achievements, with a focus on
industrial growth. In 2021, the economy experienced a strong rebound, with an estimated growth
rate of 7.2% compared to 3.8% in 2020. Overall revenues have increased, and GDP per capita
increased from $3,505 in 2020 to $3,769 in 2021, reflecting a growth rate of 3.8%. Nevertheless,
challenges such as resource mobilization, resilience to external shocks and the impact of the
Russia-Ukraine war, which has led to global food and oil price surges, persist.
Benin faces a growing threat of terrorist activity in its northern regions, originating from Islamist
militant groups affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group in Burkina Faso and Niger.
Currently, attacks are sporadic and limited mainly to border areas. Benin has taken several 
BTI 2024 | Benin 4
measures to counter this escalating threat. The defense budget increased by 12.2% in 2022 and the
country has diversified its military partnerships. Benin is strengthening security cooperation with
Rwanda and the United States, while increasing its active engagement in regional
counterinsurgency efforts, and maintaining its longstanding security partnership with France.
History and Characteristics of Transformation
Following independence in 1960, Benin experienced a period of political instability and military
interventions. The last coup took place in October 1972, resulting in 17 years of military rule under
Commandant Mathieu Kérékou, who established a Marxist-Leninist regime. However, due to
economic failures and loss of support from the Eastern Bloc, the regime collapsed. In 1990, the
National Conference, comprising politicians and civil society leaders, voted overwhelmingly to
adopt a multiparty system, making Benin a trailblazer for democratization in Francophone Africa.
The first free and fair elections in 1991 resulted in the victory of the transition government of
Prime Minister Nicéphore Soglo, solidifying the new political order outlined in the 1990
constitution. Kérékou returned to power in the presidential elections of 1996, surprising many with
his win, and was re-elected in 2001. Outsider Thomas Boni Yayi triumphed in the 2006
presidential elections, showcasing the competitive nature of Beninese politics and the limited
relevance of political parties. Yayi’s unexpected re-election in 2011, without a runoff, triggered
allegations of fraud from the opposition. During his second term, Yayi faced increasing criticism
for his perceived authoritarianism.
In 2012, President Patrice Talon, a wealthy businessman, was accused of plotting against Yayi
and attempting to poison him. Although Yayi eventually pardoned Talon in 2014, the incident,
known as the Talon Affair, exposed the fragility of democracy in Benin and polarized the country.
Contrary to rumors, Yayi did not attempt to modify the constitution to run for a third term. In the
2016 elections, former Prime Minister Lionel Zinsou ran as the presidential candidate for the proYayi party, Cowry Forces for an Emergent Benin (FCBE). However, Talon, running as an
independent, emerged victorious in the runoff, garnering support from defeated first-round
candidates and defectors from the FCBE.
Talon’s 2016 presidential victory was based on his promise to break with the tendencies of Yayi’s
controversial presidential administration. He pledged to defend and strengthen Benin’s democratic
institutions, including limiting the presidential mandate to a single term and modernizing the
economy. Upon taking office, Talon initiated numerous political, institutional and economic
reforms, outlined in the Government’s Action Program (PAG) for 2016 – 2021. However, he faced
strong opposition from political actors. In April 2017, his constitutional reform process in the
National Assembly lacked support from opposition members of parliament. Nonetheless, a new
law was successfully adopted, changing the partisan system, and parliamentary elections were held
in April 2019 without the participation of opposition parties. Only two pro-Talon political parties,
the Republican Bloc (BP) and the Progressive Union (UP), participated in this election, which had 
BTI 2024 | Benin 5
low voter turnout (22.99%), electoral violence in several cities and sparked a serious political
crisis. Supporters of former President Boni Yayi protested the election, leading to confrontations
with the police and army. The new assembly favored the regime and proceeded to revise the
constitution in November 2019. The opposition was subsequently absent from elections in 2019
and 2021.
Benin’s democratic development has faced significant challenges. The 2019 and 2021 elections
were marred by violence and a heavily skewed electoral code disadvantaged opposition parties.
Voter turnout plummeted to just over 20%. However, the legislative election held in January 2023
occurred in a relatively open political landscape, with seven parties participating – four aligned
with Talon and three in opposition. The Union progressiste and the Bloc républicain, the two
governing parties, secured 81 out of the 109 seats in parliament. New electoral rules guaranteed at
least 26 seats for women, resulting in women winning 29 seats (26.60%).
After the fall of Kérékou’s Marxist-Leninist regime in 1991, Benin initially experienced a
successful economic transformation with strong support from international donors. The Soglo
presidency implemented radical reforms, resulting in his electoral defeat in 1996. While Kérékou’s
return to power did not significantly alter the strategy for reforms, economic progress stagnated
during his presidency. Yayi’s victory in the 2006 elections raised hopes for combating corruption
and advancing the economic transformation, but his performance left many Beninese
disappointed. The Talon government, elected in 2016, announced economic reforms but faced
challenges in mobilizing funds for implementing the flagship projects outlined in the PAG.
Nonetheless, Talon made some progress, particularly in vital sectors like agriculture and port
activities. However, his status as a prominent businessman potentially conflicts with his
commitment to economic transformation.
In the 2021 election, Talon was re-elected, against his initial promise to serve only a single term.
The election was conducted under restrictive rules that prevented many opposition politicians from
running. Under the Government Action Program (GAP II) for 2021 – 2026, Talon announced a
continuation of previous policies, though with increased focus on addressing social issues.

The state maintains nationwide control over the use of force. There are no active
armed rebel groups originating from Benin within the country. However, in recent
months, Benin has faced jihadist attacks from neighboring countries, particularly
Burkina Faso. Since 2019, terrorist attacks and kidnappings have been on the rise,
with the northern region experiencing regular infiltrations by terrorist groups. Areas
such as the W and Pendjari national parks, as well as the Alibori and Atakora regions,
have been particularly targeted. Several attacks on police stations have also been
reported, primarily in the north of the country. In response, Benin is on high alert for
terrorist activities. The government has increased its military presence at border
bases. There has been an increase in reports of radical Islamic preachers entering the
country. To combat this, the government has established the National Commission to
Combat Radicalization, Violent Extremism, and Terrorism (CNLRET).
In rural areas, conflicts between herders and farmers have been reported, especially
in the lower Ouémé Valley and the Niger Valley, where groups that also settle in
Niger and Nigeria reside. The peaceful parliamentary elections held in January 2023
provide hope for a return to social cohesion. However, crime remains a serious issue
that has not been effectively addressed. Incidents of road and armed robberies occur
regularly, despite the merger of the police and gendarmerie into a unified force called
the Republican Police in January 2018, with the aim to enhance crime-fighting
capabilities.

In stark contrast to other West African coastal states such as Côte d’Ivoire, there are
no problems in defining citizenship and who qualifies as a citizen in Benin.
Government action does not discriminate on ethnic, religious or cultural grounds, and
the legitimacy of the republic is not questioned in principle. There is no dominant
group that identifies itself as the core group of Benin’s heterogeneous society.
However, an NGO report identifies a strong historical divide between the northern
part of the country (mainly the provinces of Atakora, Alibori, Borgou and Donga)
and the southern provinces of Zou, Atlantique and Ouémé. Before colonialism, the
latter used to belong to the kingdoms of Dahomey (Zou and Atlantique) and PortoState identity
9
BTI 2024 | Benin 7
Novo (Ouémé). While the two kingdoms were involved in slave trading and
politically favored in colonial times, they were at odds with each other. As a result,
post-colonial Benin was politically divided into three parts representing internally
heterogeneous communities. While northerners were perceived to be privileged and
favored during President Yayi’s rule (2006 – 2016), southerners are now perceived
to be privileged by the incumbent president, Patrice Talon. Talon openly stated that
he would favor merit and competence over regional equilibrium in office
appointments. This might potentially put northerners at disadvantage. The north is
the least developed part of the country and has less educated citizens and trained civil
servants than the south. Regionalist overtones are increasingly present, particularly
in political speeches. In September 2018, during a political meeting, a group of young
people launched “Nikki’s initiative” in response to the marginalization of northerners
in the appointments made by President Talon’s government. The young people
behind this act have been prosecuted.
Separation between religion and the state is guaranteed by the secular 1990
constitution, and religious or ethnic extremists command no political influence.
Although politics is still defined along ethnoregional cleavages, there is a
fundamental national sense of solidarity and an elementary constitutional patriotism.
The country has established a platform for inter-religious dialogue. Since 2015, Benin
has hosted the African Initiative for Peace and Development Education by Interreligious Dialogue, which is supported by the African Union (AU). Catholics are
over-represented in state offices as a result of the role of the church in education.
However, this does not transfer into dogmatic interference. For instance, President
Talon met with all the religious leaders after taking office, asking them, among other
things, to stay away from politics. Under his government, a law allowing abortion
was adopted in 2021 with almost no major contestation, especially from the Catholic
Church.
Generally, religious pluralism and tolerance are the rule. There are some
preoccupations for the rise of evangelical groups and local religions (Voodoo,
Banamè church) and their close relationships to politicians. The risk that Muslim
extremism might spill over from neighboring countries such as Nigeria or Mali,
especially in the north, has materialized in recent months, although only in rather
isolated incidents. Individual extremist preachers are common, though there is no
reliable information about either the extent of their influence or their connection to
jihadist groups.

The state’s basic administrative structure exists throughout the country’s entire
territory, but its operation is checkered. The greatest accomplishment of the public
sector in recent years has arguably been the extension of basic education to achieve
almost full enrollment. In rural areas, however, the performance of political and
judicial decision-making is deficient, and the allocation of public goods is inefficient.
The largely donor-driven decentralization process, which includes capacity-building
and civic education policies, has slowly started to improve socioeconomic conditions
and strengthen the presence of basic administrative infrastructure. Still, legal
standards are not enforced, and corruption remains a systemic problem, despite the
Talon government’s efforts. Examples include the state’s inability to enforce import
regulations and the enormous delays in public prosecutions, which have led to
prolonged pretrial detentions.
According to World Bank development indicators published in 2022, 65.4% of the
population has access to a basic water source, 17% has access to basic sanitation and
41.4% has access to electricity. These figures mask disparities between urban areas,
which are generally well provided for, and rural ones.
The transport infrastructure is insufficient, making it difficult to transport people and
goods from the countryside to urban centers.

2 | Political Participation
Free and fair elections have been the norm in Benin from 1990 to 2016, where all
candidates could contest elections. However, the reforms introduced by President
Talon erected a major barrier that severely limited the participation of several
political parties in the April 2019 legislative elections and hindered opposition
candidates in the following elections. These barriers included a dramatic increase in
the deposit candidates have to pay (nonrefundable with less than 10% of votes),
demanding that presidential candidates be sponsored by at least 10% of members of
parliament and mayors, requesting that candidates include proof they owe no taxes in
their applications, and increasing the costs for setting up political parties. All these
provisions contribute to restricting political and electoral spaces. As a result, it
became easy for whoever is in power to decide: (i) who can be presidential election
candidates by controlling the sponsorship process (as in 2021), (ii) who can be
candidates for legislative elections (like the legislative elections in 2023, when people
on the opposition party’s list were denied proof of no tax obligations).
These reforms sparked a boycott by opposition parties in the parliamentary elections
of April 2019 and in the May 2020 communal elections. The presidential elections
held in April 2021 took place without the participation of opposition candidates, such
as Rekya Madougou and Joel Aivo, who were rejected because they had not obtained
the required number of sponsors to field a candidate, 16 deputies and/or mayors. The
electoral administration is sufficiently independent but disorganized. The
Autonomous National Electoral Commission (CENA), initially appointed on a

BTI 2024 | Benin 9
temporary basis, was turned into a permanent body in 2014. CENA successfully
organized parliamentary elections in 2015 and 2019, local elections in 2020 and
presidential elections in early 2016. In March 2022, a technical body, the General
Direction of Elections (DGE), was set up to support CENA in the organization of
elections. The January 2023 elections that followed were thus organized more
successfully than the previous ones. The voters’ list compiled in 2011 is regularly
updated, although there have been some protests from opposition parties. It was
updated in 2020 and 2022 essentially without opposition representatives. The
management of the LEPI (Liste Electorale Permanente Informatisée) has been
reorganized. In March 2022, the Agence Nationale d’Identification des Personnes
(ANIP) was entrusted with the management of the electoral list for the 2023
legislative elections in accordance with the new electoral code. However, updating
the list and the limited financial resources allocated to managing it created
organizational problems, resulting in tensions between government and the
opposition. In particular, under the rule of President Yayi, local elections initially
scheduled for 2013 were postponed until June 2015 due to the non-availability of an
updated list. Electoral violence in the aftermath of disputed legislative elections and
low voter participation in communal and parliamentary elections are signs of Benin’s
democracy weakening. Presidential elections in 2021 were held without participation
by opposition candidates. Out of the 20 candidates the Electoral Commission
registered, only three pairs were finally selected. Opponents accuse the president of
withdrawing sponsorships and of choosing his own challengers. Things were
relatively open during the recent parliamentarian elections held on January 8, 2023,
when seven political parties were in competition. Finally, in the new National
Assembly that took office in February 2023, the opposition party, Les Démocrates,
has 28 seats and the Union Progressiste and Bloc Républicain that support President
Talon have 53 and 28 seats, respectively.
The government has the effective power to govern. However, it remains unclear
whether the president was democratically elected. Decisions of (elected) officials can
sometimes be influenced by third parties such as business, religious or traditional
leaders, but not in a systematic way. The army, formerly a major power player, has
receded from the political scene and appears unwilling to re-emerge. The peaceful
and democratic transfer of power from Boni Yayi to his rival Patrice Talon is further
evidence of the loyalty of the military to the laws of the republic. The appointment
of the 12 prefects in accordance with the new organization of the administration into
12 departments has strengthened the capacity of the state to exercise power. However,
political enclaves are more likely to exist at the local level where the elected
municipal councilors enter a political field already occupied by various chiefs,
notables and non-elected actors. State capacities at this level are often very low. This
leads to parts of the population becoming disinterested in elected representatives and
encourages them to turn to local actors who are more effective in meeting their needs,
such as local customary leaders and religious service providers.

Freedom of expression is constitutionally guaranteed (since 1990) and individuals are
free to organize themselves into political parties or non-governmental associations.
However, the recent political reforms adopted by the Talon regime have introduced
a number of restrictions. For example, the new charter of political parties adopted in
July 2018 requires the mobilization of at least 1,155 founding members at the national
level (15 per commune) compared with 120 (10 per department) previously.
Although freedom of association is still recognized, the exercise of this right has been
restricted. Thus, the right to strike for health and justice workers was removed by law
in 2018 and then for workers in the transportation, airport and hydrocarbon sectors in
2022. In addition, new restrictions are being placed on workers’ right to strike,
limiting them to a maximum of 10 days per year. These various reforms are
considered to be serious threats to freedom of association and assembly. However,
the unions continue to operate, representing the interests of the relatively small formal
labor force – mostly public employees – but now wielding less power than before
relative to the state. Civil society actors who used to play a watchdog role vis-à-vis
formal politics are increasingly co-opted by the government. While this was already
the case under President Yayi’s rule, it has become more common under Patrice
Talon, who came to power with strong support from civil society. In particular,
Citizens’ Alternative, the civil society coalition led by Professor Joseph Djogbénou,
has become a political party and has played a major role in the last parliamentary,
local and presidential elections.

The constitution guarantees freedom of expression and there is a multitude of private
media that provide different opinions. State and numerous private media operate
freely, but the latter are much more constrained by the financial influence of the
government’s communication services. There is no restriction or limit to accessing
social media networks and since April 2018 the country has had a digital code that
governs digital communication. Even if there is no explicit limitation on access to
social media, the digital code is seen as a limit to freedom of expression and press
liberty in particular. The regulation of the media sector combines both a public
institution (the High Authority for Audiovisual and Communication, HAAC) and a
professional association of journalists (the Observatory of Professional Standards and
Ethics in the Media, ODEM). Domestic respect for the HAAC, once a model for the
region, has suffered in the last few years due to the perception that it has lost its
impartiality. The mode of appointment to the HAAC has been controversial, given
that the chairman and two other members of the HAAC are nominated by the
president of Benin. Recent sanctions imposed by the HAAC on media outlets are
perceived as serious threats to press freedom in Benin, because the HAAC frequently
censures media outlets for defamation when they expose corruption or strongly
criticize the government. There was a controversial case in December 2016 with the
shut down of several media outlets, notably radio Soleil FM, SIKA TV, Eden TV and
E Television, close to Sébastien Ajavon (an important businessman and presidential
candidate in the last elections). The daily newspaper La Nouvelle Tribune has been

abrogated since May 2018. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) ranked Benin 121st out
of 180 countries in 2022, a decrease of 7 points from last year and 25 points from its
level in 2019. However, Benin is still in a considerably better position than its earlier
ranking of 30 some years ago. Freedom House’s Global Press Freedom survey did
not record a similar backslide, instead consistently assessing Benin as having a lower
level, “partly free,” press. In December 2019, journalist Ignace Sossou was sentenced
to 18 months in prison for having relayed on Twitter comments made by the
prosecutor of Cotonou. Cases of arrests based on comments made via social media
are increasingly frequent. Since February 2023, the journalist Virgile Ahouanse,
director of Crystal News, the online radio station, has been persecuted for
broadcasting testimony about extrajudicial killings at a primary school in Porto Novo.
The deteriorating situation in the north led to violations of the freedom to engage in
journalism. Several reporters were arrested and a foreign journalist was deported.
3 | Rule of Law
Separation of powers is constitutionally mandated but in practice, the president exerts
strong control over the majority of democratic institutions. Benin has a presidential
system in which the president frequently faces periods where the opposition has
control of the country’s unicameral legislative body, the National Assembly.
However, following the April 2019 legislative elections that led to the installation of
only the Bloc Républicain (BR) and the Union Progressiste (UP), the main parties
allied with Talon’s regime, parliament no longer acts as a balance to the power of the
president. This will continue, as both UP and BR retain a majority in the current
parliament with 83 of the total 109 seats. The judicial review by the Constitutional
Court is a cornerstone of the political system and an effective check on the
government and the National Assembly. The constitution provides for a simultaneous
appointment of all judges, three by the president and four by the executive committee
of the National Assembly. Because of the procedure to appoint judges, there have
been debates over the independence of the court under the Yayi presidency. The
debate continued with the Talon presidency when his lawyer, who became minister
of justice in the first government, was appointed president of the Constitutional Court
(June 2018 – July 2022). The subsequent reversals of case law after Djogbénou took
office suggest that the court is not fully independent. In particular, the court’s most
established members declared several new laws to be constitutionally compliant,
including those relating to the withdrawal of the right to strike from health workers,
which the previous court headed by Robert Dossou had rejected.
Separation of
powers

BTI 2024 | Benin 12
Technically, the judiciary is institutionally distinct and operates independently, but –
apart from the Constitutional Court – that independence is undermined by insufficient
territorial and functional penetration. President Talon named his personal lawyer,
Joseph Djogbénou, Constitutional Court president in 2018. Djogbénou stayed in
office until July 2022.
Access to courts has improved following assistance by the U.S.-led Millennium
Challenge Account (MCA) and by the European Union. However, corruption remains
endemic and more than one-half of the country’s magistrates have been involved in
financial scandals. The National Union of Benin Magistrates (UNAMAB), the trade
union representing magistrates, has consistently complained about a lack of
transparency in nominations and promotions. It recently issued serious criticisms of
the law establishing the Court for the Suppression of Economic Offenses and
Terrorism (CRIET) passed in May 2018, arguing it was unconstitutional and
questioning its functioning. The CRIET has distinguished itself in the eyes of
opponents of the regime. Lobbyists, friends, relatives, religious associations and other
networks influence the judiciary, undermining its independence. In addition, judges
can be pressured by political authorities or the state apparatus (e.g., the Ministry of
Justice or subordinate departments). New courts have been created in several areas in
the country to facilitate access to justice.

Prosecutions of the abuse of office increased in recent years, due to President Talon’s
commitment to fight grand and everyday corruption. Several security agents
(commander level), school principals and other civil servants who squandered public
funds intended for their public missions were relieved of their respective functions.
For instance, several ministers and high-level personnel involved in the illegal
investment of funds in ICC Services (a kind of pyramid scam) were sentenced to
prison in 2018 and 2019. In January 2021, former mayors of the municipality of
Abomey-Calavi were convicted of the same crime.
However, attempts to fight corruption by high officeholders are sometimes perceived
as witch hunts that benefit the political interests of the ruling power. For instance, the
U.S. State Department reports that in December 2021, following one-day trials based
on virtually no evidence, the Court for the Repression of Economic and Terrorism
Infractions (CRIET) convicted opposition presidential candidates Joel Aivo of money
laundering and crimes against the security of the state and Reckya Madougou of
terrorist financing. CRIET sentenced Aivo to 10 years of imprisonment and
Madougou to 20 years. Madougou was not allowed to question key witnesses and
one of her attorneys questioned CRIET’s impartiality.
Generally, watchdog organizations such as the National Authority for Fighting
Corruption (ANLC) transformed in April 2020 into the High Commission for the
Prevention of Corruption (HCPCN), and the National Front of Anti-Corruption
Organizations (FONAC) are doing their best to address the problem. HCPCN is under
the control of the presidency, which may have weakened its capabilities. Since the
ANLC was transformed into the HCPCN, there has been no sign of any new initiative.
Prosecution of
office abuse

BTI 2024 | Benin 13
Civil liberties are codified and generally guaranteed, but the legal procedures to seek
redress for violations often exist only on paper and the poor level of literacy in rural
areas makes the effective use of these rights difficult. In its 2020 report, CIVICUS
observes that civil rights have declined in Benin in recent years. The country has been
condemned by the African Court on Human and Peoples’ Rights (CADHP) over
several affairs, including the request to suspend the electoral process made by
Sébastien Ajavon, who justified the request on the basis that his right to contest
elections was not being respected.
Existing human rights violations are less the result of deliberate actions by state
agents and rather the consequence of a lack of resources, especially in the prison
system, where detainees can spend months or years under deplorable conditions,
awaiting trial because of the large backlog of court cases within the justice system.
Likewise, despite some improvements, children’s and women’s rights are not
enforced in most rural areas.
In March 2021, the country withdrew from the African Court of Human and Peoples’
Rights, so individuals and NGOs can no longer file complaints against the state.
There is a divide between northerners and southerners. The south is generally more
developed, but there is no outright discrimination against northerners or others on the
basis of religion, gender or sexual orientation, although homosexuality is not widely
accepted.

4 | Stability of Democratic Institutions
Benin has been cited as one of the most stable democratic systems in West Africa.
But since 2016, the reforms initiated by President Talon have posed a serious
challenge. Stability is not the result of institutions respecting each other’s
prerogatives or of performing their functions effectively and independently. Rather,
the lack of friction is mostly the result of the fact that all the institutions, especially
since the election of President Talon, are largely controlled by the executive.
Since 2019 the National Assembly, comprising members of parliament from the two
major political parties (Republican Bloc/BR and Progressive Union/UP), has
functioned as an institution committed to the service of the president. Following
legislative elections held in January 2023, the opposition party, Les Démocrates, will
be a dissonant voice in the new assembly, although the legislature, as a whole will,
remain compliant with Talon’s administration. Other institutions are also considered
to be under presidential control because they are headed by former collaborators or
close friends of the president. Though progress has been made, local and regional
government is still characterized by tension between traditional, appointed and
elected actors. The overall performance of the administrative and judicial systems is
not always efficient, due to general administrative weakness and the aforementioned
lack of resources. The perception of Benin’s democratic institutions suffered under

the Yayi administration due to his ad hoc politics, in which he often attempted to
sideline parliament and other institutions, though rarely with complete success.
Democratic institutions continue to suffer under Talon due to the regime’s control
over each of them. Parliament and judicial institutions are bereft of dissonant voices.
The political class and other major actors generally accept democratic institutions as
the legitimate form of political organization. There are no open campaigns against
democracy, although the executive has to some degree undermined democratic
institutions.
The country’s democratic experience from 1991 to 2016 and its pattern of peaceful
transfer of power have been major sources of national pride. This pride has waned
with new political reforms. The reforms initiated by the president were strongly
contested but finally approved by the new assembly, in which there is no
representative of the opposition. The new constitution and the new electoral have
been perceived as weakening the democratic model inherited from the national
conference of 1990. In 2020, the method of electing mayors, which had been
conducted by vote, was blocked due to the new electoral code. While in some
municipalities the vote had already taken place, the process was stopped and a new
interpretative law was submitted to parliament for approval. The new law enabled the
installation of mayors.
During the 2023 legislative elections, electoral disputes were regularly submitted to
the Constitutional Court for arbitration. In November 2022, the court’s decisions
allowed the opposition party, The Democrats, to participate in the elections.

5 | Political and Social Integration
Since the advent of multipartyism in Benin in 1990, there has been a high degree of
fragmentation, extreme volatility, and political parties that are usually based on
regional and ethnic support. Individual leaders tend to dominate organizationally
weak parties, held together by clientelist structures. Ideological polarization has been
low and severe confrontations between parties rarely occurred until recently, in the
2019 and 2021 elections.
However, the July 2018 electoral reform that – ironically – was designed to curb the
number of parties, has transformed the national political field. Ever since the
renaissance of multiparty rule in 1990, the party system has been characterized by a
low degree of institutionalization and high fragmentation. More than 150 political
parties were registered before the 2018 reform, although only 30 were in any way
politically significant. The new legal framework prescribes the required number of
founding members for a legitimate political party (raising this number from 120 to
1,155), as well as establishing rules governing the public financing of parties. As a
result, only 14 political parties could legally register in January 2021. Seven political
parties participated in the January 2023 legislative election and three of them won
seats in parliament. These reforms are the origin of political crises in 2019 and 2021.
Party system

BTI 2024 | Benin 15
The topography of interest groups is relatively close-knit, though not all interests are
equally represented. Rural and urban interests translate into the party system and
explain the astonishingly high number of political parties. However, urban interests
combined with personal rent-seeking are over-represented. Institutionalized trade
unions have been very strong since the Marxist-Leninist period, but, in a country
where the large majority of the population works in the informal economy, they only
represent formal employees, mostly from the public sector. In June 2018, the
Constitutional Court validated the new law on the right to strike, which has weakened
trade union power considerably. There has been no strike called since the law was
approved. Trade union elections held in January 2021 suggest that only three trade
unions and confederations are representative. Starting in April 2022, the government
met with trade unions and agreed to increase the minimum wage for private and
public sector employees.
Some groups of workers from the informal sectors, such as informal traders who
account for 70% of non-industrial gasoline consumption, have associations whose
representatives negotiate directly with the government. The NGO sector is highly
dependent on foreign capital, but urban civil society has a considerable impact on the
political process. The government co-opted some activists from civil society (e.g.,
Citizen Alternative leaders Joseph Djogbénou and Orden Alladatin) and since then,
civil society has become less politically vocal, with the exception of Social Watch,
which has established an initiative called the PAG Citizens’ Watch. However, the
majority of NGOs are less political and work in the interest of the association’s aims,
but also frequently in accordance with the material interests of the association’s
leadership.
Interest groups

Levels of approval toward democratic norms and procedures are very high, and this
is reflected in the data from Afrobarometer surveys. According to Afrobarometer
2022, support for democracy is stable: 79% of respondents considered democracy
preferable to any other system of government and 90% of respondents disagreed with
the idea of abolishing elections and the National Assembly. However, the last two
legislative and municipal elections, which saw a low rate of participation reflect the
problems of representativeness created by the new democratic system.
Citizens are unsatisfied with the country’s democratic performance (let alone
economic performance). For instance, according to Afrobarometer 2022, only 6.7%
of them are very satisfied with democracy and 55.6% are either not at all satisfied or
not very satisfied with democracy. Trust in the president was 56% of all respondents,
and only local councils and officials were trusted more (58%). However, the National
Assembly and the political parties are trusted far less trust (42% and 36%
respectively). The most trusted institutions are religious (74%) and traditional leaders
(67%), as well as the armed forces (67%).

Social self-organization and the creation of social capital are strong, although these
organizations are often locally limited and, therefore, do not cross the main linguistic
and ethnic barriers (more bonding than bridging social capital). Apart from the high
number of military takeovers after independence, Benin has a history of peaceful
resolution of conflicts and no political violence. Social tolerance is increasing in
Benin according to Afrobarometer data. This success can be attributed, among other
reasons, to the Beninese’s overarching trust in their society’s capacity to find
consensus as well as a balanced representation of the population in state institutions.
Mutual trust suffered to some extent due to President Yayi’s less conciliatory rhetoric.
Under President Talon, tensions may have increased further due to his controversial
reforms. Post-election violence was recorded during legislative elections in 2019 and
presidential elections in 2021. The most recent legislative elections in January 2023
were very peaceful. Increasing political divisions and numerous legal actions against
state officials have reduced confidence in the government, although comprehensive
data on levels of trust are not available.

Question
Score
Benin has experienced sustained economic growth during the period of review. In
July 2020, the World Bank ranked the country for the first time as a lower middleincome country. Gross national income increased from $870 to $1,250. However,
Benin is still a long way from achieving sustainable poverty reduction. It is one of
the world’s least developed countries. The country is ranked 166th out of 189 with a
value of 0.525 on the Human Development Index. Benin is making progress in
particular in the areas of health and income, construction and services, with average
economic growth rates exceeding 7.2% in 2021 according to the World Bank. A few
years ago, Benin came close to the level of “medium human development,” as defined
by the UNDP. However, it has plateaued since. The country exhibits social
marginalization that is quantitatively and qualitatively extensive and structurally
ingrained. The overall loss in HDI due to inequality is 36.4% in 2021.
The population was 12.45 million in 2021 with a fertility rate of 5.7 children per
woman and a life expectancy of 61.2 years. The national poverty rate was 53.2%
(59.9% in 2015). The international poverty (PPP) rate of $1.90 per day was estimated
at 19.2% in 2019. The Gini index declined from 47.8 in 2015 to 37.8 in 2018.
According to an assessment by the African Development Bank (AfDB), development
is not geographically uniform, with urban and coastal areas benefiting significantly
more from development than rural areas. Rising inequalities have incited internal

underprivileged people and unemployed young university graduates. The majority of
the population is engaged in the subsistence economy and the country has one of the
largest informal sectors in the world. Gender inequality is also relatively high. Benin
scores 0.602 in the 2021 Gender Inequality Index (ranking 148th out of 162

In 2018/2019, only 54.8% of students were able to complete primary education.

7 | Organization of the Market and Competition
The Heritage Foundation considers Benin “moderately free” in economic terms,
ranking it 84th out of over 150 countries worldwide (and 7th in sub-Saharan Africa).
However, according to The International Labor Organization in 2022, informal
employment in Benin was 96.9% in 2018. The large informal sector, estimated at
over 48% of GDP, is based primarily on unregulated trade with Nigeria. The country
has a small domestic market, although the basic institutional framework for market
competition has been increasingly strengthened in Benin over the last two decades.
According to the U.S. government, a U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)
compact focused on regional integration and transport was signed in December 2022,
with $202 million for road infrastructure improvements, accompanied by policy and
institutional reforms to strengthen road maintenance, freight traffic and cross-border
trade, particularly with Niger.
In January 2022, the Beninese government published its Second Government Action
Plan (PAG II) with a budget of $20.6 billion. The PAG II lists more than 340 projects
in 23 sectors and has a new focus on education and social services. Potential
infrastructure projects include road, airport and railway construction, port expansion,
housing, telecommunications, information technology and energy development.
For investors who wish to establish a business in Benin, the government has
established a stand-alone one-stop shop to facilitate registration of new businesses
within two days.
The introduction of deadlines for deeds of transfer of property, the new online
cadastral map, and the establishment of a dispute management process have all
contributed to the improved performance of the country. However, Benin’s business
environment remains poor, and the informal sector dominates the economy. Despite
the progress made, poor energy and transport infrastructure constitute major
challenges.
Market

At least in principle, Benin is committed to implementing West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU) community legislation on competition. Benin’s
legal framework does not address antitrust or competition issues. The Ministry of
Trade is in charge of supervision and the Authority for the Regulation of Electronic
Communications and Post (ARCEP) is mandated to promote concurrence in the
communication sector. In some cases, antitrust legislation is enforced. In July 2020,
West African hotel developer Teyliom International filed a request for arbitration
with the World Bank International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes
(ICSID) in relation to the Beninese government’s expropriation of a hotel the
company had been constructing in Cotonou. This is an example of how Patrice
Talon’s rule is problematic, given his conflict of interests as a major businessman

BTI 2024 | Benin 19
involved in strategic sectors of the economy. Talon and his family have complete
control over the cotton sector, owning 51% of the Society for the Development of
Cotton (SODECO) through his private companies and controlling the remaining 49%
of shares held by the state as president. Talon is also involved in the management of
the Port of Cotonou, through the Import Verification Program (PVI) managed by
Benin Control SA. This program had been canceled by his predecessor, but Talon
chose to resurrect it. Formal antitrust rules do not affect the country’s large informal
sector. Although the informal sector is in general characterized by micro and small
businesses, the most profitable informal economic activities, such as the re-export of
goods to Nigeria, are controlled by a few powerful economic operators. Benin is not
a member of the International Competition Network.
Benin has a liberal institutional trade framework, but commercial exchanges are
hampered by a lack of modern technical equipment and bureaucratic barriers. Benin
is a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the West African Economic
and Monetary Union (WAEMU), under whose rules trade is to a great extent
liberalized.
According to the Institut National de la Statistique et de la Démographie (INSTAD),
Benin’s merchandise exports rose by 24.1% in the first quarter of 2022 to XOF 175.6
billion, year-on-year. Similarly, merchandise imports increased by 8.1% to XOF
462.9 billion. In this context, the trade balance showed a deficit of XOF -287.3 billion
in the first quarter of 2022 compared to XOF -286.9 billion a year earlier.
According to the Heritage Foundation, Benin’s economic freedom score is 59.8
(“moderately free”), making its economy the 84th freest in the 2023 Index. Its score
is 4.6 points better than in 2020, when it was 55.2. Benin is ranked 7th among 47
countries in the sub-Saharan Africa region, and its overall score is above the regional
and world averages. According to the Heritage Foundation’s index, the tradeweighted average tariff rate is 12.1%, and non-tariff measures are in force. However,
dynamic flows of foreign investment are constrained by persistent policy and
institutional weaknesses. The index also reports that, despite the development of
microfinance institutions, overall access to credit remains low.
Trade liberalization has increased in West Africa due to progress toward the adoption
of an Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) with the European Union, Benin’s
largest trading partner, and the launch of the Economic Community of the West
African States (ECOWAS) Common External Tariff (CET). Nigeria, a neighbor of
Benin and the largest African economy, has not yet signed the agreement, thereby
blocking its provisional application. The EPA has not been ratified by all ECOWAS
member states. The EPA would commit the European Union and ECOWAS to the
progressive and asymmetrical liberalization of trade, in a way that takes into account
the difference in levels of development between the two blocs. It also aims to
strengthen cooperation in sectors relating to trade and represents a potentially positive
development for Benin. Exports passing through the Port of Cotonou have steadily

declined. A lack of technical maintenance and corruption have contributed to this
decline. Foreign trade activities have suffered somewhat from the COVID-19
pandemic and the closure of the border with Nigeria but have been recovering since
2021. To boost the profitability of the Port of Cotonou, the government opted for a
public-private partnership by delegating management to the Port of Antwerp
International (PAI) in January 2018. Patrice Talon has relaunched the Import
Verification Program, which aims to establish an electronic system to facilitate
customs procedures. The program is also affected by a conflict of interest since it is
managed by a company owned by President Talon.
The financial sector in Benin has developed considerably from a very low starting
point. It is relatively differentiated and aligned, in principle, with international
standards. However, the sector suffers from institutional weaknesses. Due to a large
informal economy and widespread poverty, relatively few enterprises have access to
the banking system. The financial system remains underdeveloped. Banks have
continued to increase their domestic assets, and there are many microfinance
institutions, but overall access to credit remains limited. Assessing the quality of the
banking sector quantitatively is difficult as recent numbers on non-performing loans
and other indicators do not exist.
According to the World Bank’s financial sector review (2018), Benin’s financial
sector is shallow and segmented, with 15 banks and over 600 microfinance
institutions (MFIs), of which 111 were authorized at the end of 2022 and the
remaining are unauthorized or nonbank financial institutions (two licensed e-money
issuers, 14 insurance companies and two pension funds). Commercial banks and
other credit institutions are governed by the regional banking law and supervised by
the Banking Commission (Commission Bancaire). The Central Bank of West African
States (BCEAO) also supervises large MFIs falling under “Article 44” (that is, MFIs
with an outstanding credit portfolio or total of deposits of at least XOF 2 billion).
According to the Heritage Foundation, 10 MFIs are supervised by the BCEAO. Emoney issuers are also under the scope of the BCEAO. The insurance sector is
regulated by the Conference Interafricaine des Marchés de l’Assurance (CIMA).
Difficulties in lending to the private sector have encouraged banks to lend to the state,
a trend that has increased in the last decade. The predominance of the informal and
subsistence economies has encouraged the diffusion of microfinance institutions
(MFIs). Following a remediation plan implemented in 2018, several MFIs were
closed in 2018. At the end of 2022, a total of 111 MFIs were authorized to conduct
all or part of the deposit-taking operations, lending and commitment by signature.
The most important networks are the Federation of Savings Banks and Mutual
Agricultural Credit of Benin (FECECAM), the National Union of Rural Savings and
Loan Banks (UNACREP) and the National Network of Self-managed Village
Savings and Credit Unions of Benin (RENACA). MFIs for which data was available
in 2014 had a profitability ratio below average WAEMU levels, which could
undermine their growth.

8 | Monetary and fiscal stability
As a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU), Benin
cannot pursue an independent policy on currency and foreign exchange rates. The
currency is pegged to the euro, and the Central Bank of West African States (Banque
Centrale des États de l’Afrique de l’Ouest, BCEAO) is fully independent but heavily
influenced by the European Central Bank’s anti-inflation policy. After the common
currency CFA franc was devalued in 1994, inflation has remained relatively low,
falling sharply to 1.7% in 2021, down from 3.0% in 2020 (in 2019 it was -0.7%). The
IMF has highlighted a moderate increase in inflation at 1.7% in 2021, which remains
under the 3% WAEMU convergence criteria. Data on the real effective exchange rate
is not available.
Monetary stability

In close collaboration with the IMF and the World Bank, the Benin government is
committed to structurally transform the country’s economy by implementing a rigid
policy with regard to public expenditure.
Expansionary fiscal policies were pursued and the fiscal deficit (grants included)
widened from 4.7% of GDP in 2020 to 5.7% in 2021. The World Bank considers
overall revenues to have remained fairly resilient and that response plans significantly
increased government expenditure in 2020/2021. Likewise, fiscal measures adopted
to support the purchasing power of households put a strain on public accounts with
the result that the deficit is expected to remain high in 2022.
In 2020, total debt service in 2020 is $288.8 million and external debt is $5,250.5
million. Public debt at the end of 2021 was 49.9% of GDP. This is below the
WAEMU average of 70%. The current account balance was -$274.0 million in 2020,
with government consumption 11.4% of GDP.
Ongoing reforms have created fiscal space by stimulating growth in domestic
revenue. In 2020 the national budget faced the double impact of a fall in domestic
income due to the pandemic and associated measures (including temporary tax cuts)
and the Nigerian crisis and increased public spending. Despite several efforts to
improve internal tax collection, the predominance of the informal sector poses a
challenge to growing this source of income at a large scale. Nevertheless, Benin
remains a country at low risk of debt distress. The current account deficit has
increased moderately over the review period and is projected to represent an average
of 8.6% of GDP between 2019 and 2022 and remain stable thereafter.
Benin is on the list of 25 countries to which the IMF has granted debt service relief
under the Disaster Response and Relief Trust Fund. In May 2020, the IMF Executive
Board approved an immediate disbursement of $125.1 million (or 0.87% of Benin’s
GDP) to Benin to address urgent financing needs to reduce the spread of COVID-19
and mitigate its economic and social impacts. Additional domestic financing for the

budget plan is estimated at XOF 65.4 billion ($109 million or 0.76% of GDP). Within
the budget envelope, authorities reallocated XOF 31 billion from low-priority
investment projects and XOF 19.7 billion from recurrent expenditures.
9 | Private Property
Property rights are adequately defined but cannot be considered satisfactorily
safeguarded because of shortcomings in the rule of law, especially corruption and
institutional pluralism. According to the Property Rights Alliance, Benin’s
International Property Rights Index (IPRI) score decreased by -0.263 to 4.327,
making it 11th in the Africa region and 89th in the world. Most land in Benin is
customary land and occupants lack formal documents to prove ownership. The
conventional process for land registration is too expensive and complex for most rural
landholders. Moreover, customary practice excludes or limits the access to land
ownership to vulnerable groups (women, migrants, pastoralists). Benin has made a
series of efforts to reform land tenure. The Rural Land Act of 2007 introduced the
Rural Land Plan, a land use and tenure map that registers all rights over land and
natural resources. A new land law has been adopted in 2013. The law aims to better
define property rights by recognizing only the Certificat de Propriété Foncière (CPF)
as a property title. The law also established the National Agency of Lands (ANDF),
which was officially launched in 2016. The agency is supposed to deliver the CPFs
and put in place an electronic system to manage information about land tenure.
Although the creation of the ANDF is a positive step, the complexity of the land
tenure problem encourages cautious expectations. According to the World Bank,
Benin has improved the reliability and transparency of land administration as well as
the speed at which the procedures for the transfer of property are conducted.
Property rights

Private enterprise is viewed institutionally as a primary engine of economic
production. Legal and institutional arrangements have been developed to support
them. In addition, the current administration has adopted measures, such as fiscal
advantages, to benefit private companies. However, almost the entire economy is
controlled by a few powerful people, limiting those measures’ attractiveness to
investors.
Private companies are free to operate, although institutional weaknesses pose
substantial constraints on them. The Yayi presidency undertook or relaunched
privatization programs in several strategic industries. The Talon administration seems
intent on pursuing further privatizations rather than public-private partnerships. In
addition to the privatization of the ports and the cotton sector, several other state
companies and public services have seen their management entrusted to private
parties (e.g., airports, school canteens, health insurance). Trade unions have voiced
their opposition to these programs due to a fear of job losses. Privatizations, as well
as the award of public tenders, are not always conducted in a transparent manner and
there is conflict between public and private interests. Many contracts are signed over
the counter, raising questions regarding their long-term security.

10 | Welfare Regime
Upon taking office for his second term, President Talon announced that it would
focus on social development. Since then, some effort has been made to improve the
social welfare system. In January 2023, the formal minimum wage was increased
from XOF 40,000 per month to XOF 52,000 per month. Salaries also increased
slightly. However, the majority of people benefit neither from the minimum wage nor
from the salary increase, due to their informal employment or dependence on
subsistence agriculture. Restrictions on working hours, and health and safety
standards are rarely enforced. The government has made some progress, but Benin –
as in most African countries – failed to achieve all the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs). Individual goals were met, particularly educational goals. However,
the overall picture remains miserable, in particular with regard to an increase in
extreme poverty and undernourishment. Only employees in the small formal sector
can rely on pension funds. Workers are permitted to unionize (except those working
in the justice, health, oil and transportation sectors) and strike (although limited to a
maximum of 10 days per year), but the existing trade unions tend to represent public
sector employees, who already enjoy better working conditions than the majority of
the population. Social safety nets are more efficiently provided by NGOs, and
traditional clan and family structures, but their contribution to poverty reduction is
hard to measure.
The government has initiated a Human Capital Building Insurance (ARCH) project
that is expected to provide better social security, including a health insurance scheme
for the population. According to data from Afrobarometer 2020 and 2022,
unemployment, especially that of young people, is the main problem facing the
country. As part of the implementation of social measures related to the COVID-19
pandemic, the government of Benin has implemented a support program of XOF
74.12 billion, in favor of formal businesses, artisans and small traders, informal
services, and vulnerable people such as the poor and extreme poor.
In general, policies for providing social services are minimal, and health spending is
insufficient.

Differences in opportunities in Benin do not stem from active discrimination of
particular groups but from general inequalities, mainly between an educated urban
class and the majority of rural poor. Benin’s level of socioeconomic inequality is
relatively high compared with other West African countries.
The most recent literacy rate published by World Bank was 54.0% for males and
31.1% for females. The gross enrollment ratio in 2022 showed more progress in
primary education (114.2%) than in secondary (47.5%) and tertiary education
(11.1%). The ratio of female to male enrollment (GPI) in education in 2022 was 0.9
Equal opportunity
5
BTI 2024 | Benin 24
for primary, 0.8 for secondary and 0.5 for tertiary level, respectively, showing that
girls are more disadvantaged than boys in learning opportunities. In 2021, a survey
conducted by the World Bank revealed that 58% of individuals had experienced a
decline in income, while 5% had no income. Benin’s Gini index data was 37.8 % in
2018, according to a World Bank estimate. This is a decrease from 47.8 % in 2015.
In 2019, Benin had a UNDP Gender Inequality Index score of 0.612, making it 148th
out of 162 countries surveyed. Although updated figures are lacking, evidence
suggests that gender-based violence is widespread. In January 2012, a new law
introducing harsher punishments for violence against women was adopted but is not
consistently enforced. Education gender parity has increased by 20% over the last 15
years. However, women still have unequal access to secondary and tertiary education.
The UNDP found that 18.3% of adult women reached at least a secondary level of
education, compared to 33.9% of their male counterparts. In spite of these
disadvantages, Beninese women are heavily engaged in the labor market, despite
being under-represented. Female participation in the labor market is 68.8% compared
to 73.0% for men. The World Bank has estimated that 25.9% of Beninese firms have
a senior female manager, compared to a regional average of 16.3%. However, the
positive trend mainly reflects small firms (five to 19 employees), while larger firms
are overwhelmingly managed by men.
In general, women are under-represented in political office. In the May 2020
municipal elections, 4.3% of councilors were women and there were four women
mayors out of 77 elected. As the result of the political reforms, progress has been
made recently, with 26.60% of National Assembly representatives being women.
Discrimination based on race, gender, disability, language and social status is legally
prohibited. Benin is an ethnically and religiously diverse country, and religious and
ethnic groups are not discriminated against, although some societal stereotypes and
inequalities exist. There is no legal right to same-sex relationships and no legal
restrictions on the right of pro-LGBTQ+ rights organizations to operate. However,
women and disabled people continue to experience discrimination. Disabled people
currently receive no significant help from the state, but a draft law strengthening the
rights of disabled people, together with the ARCH project launched by President
Talon’s administration, will offer improved support to disabled and other vulnerable
people.

11 | Economic Performance
The overall macroeconomic situation of the country appears stable. According to the
World Bank, the economy rebounded strongly in 2021, growing at an estimated 7.2%
from 3.8% in 2020. The main drivers of growth were the services and construction
sectors. Inflation was 1.7% on average in 2021, but inflationary pressures have
increased significantly since, driven by higher food and petroleum prices. Inflation
also has accelerated since the start of the full-scale war in Ukraine.
The World Bank also reports that, due to expansionary fiscal policies, the fiscal
deficit increased from 4.7% of GDP in 2020 to 5.7% of GDP in 2021. The budget
deficit grew in 2021 to 6.1% of GDP. Public debt was 49.1% of GDP in 2021 against
46.1% in 2020. But the risk of debt distress remains moderate, according to the World
Bank.
Overall revenues remained fairly steady. GDP per capita grew from $3,505 in 2020
to $3,769 in 2021, a growth of 3.8%. Response plans significantly increased
government expenditure during the 2020/2021 period. Fiscal measures adopted to
support the purchasing power of households put a strain on public accounts so that
the deficit is expected to remain high in 2022.
According to the African Development Bank, the current account deficit is estimated
to have doubled in 2021, reaching 3.7% of GDP, due to a 64.5% decrease in public
transfers; the financial system was strengthened with the fall in the rate of outstanding
loans to 14.8% in September 2021 from 17% in September 2020. The national
poverty rate was 38.5%, while, in 2021, unemployment was 1.6%, underemployment
72%, and informal employment 90.1%. Foreign exchange reserves are forecast to
increase to six months of import cover on average in 2022/2023. Foreign Direct
Investments (FDI) saw sustained growth between 2004 and 2014, reaching a peak of
4.2% of GDP in 2014, but since experienced a decline (to 2.7% of GDP in 2015, and
1.7% of GDP in 2016 and 2017; 1.5% in 2019 and 1.1% in 2020). Benin’s current
account balance has remained consistently negative. According to the IMF, the
current account balance in 2020 was $274.0 million.
The main risks to the economy are a resurgent health crisis, fluctuations in cotton and
oil prices, the impacts of the Russo–Ukrainian war, adverse weather and deteriorating
security in northern regions.

Benin has had a legislative framework for environmental protection since 1999 and
has ratified all major international environmental conventions. Environmentally
sustainable economic growth received only sporadic consideration in the past.
However, Benin’s rank in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI) rose from
167th to 155th (out of over 160 countries), representing an increase of 1.60 points
over the past decade.
Generally, environmental concerns receive rather limited consideration. However,
the 2015 Paris Climate Conference and the PAG (2016-2021) have led to a renewed
interest in environmental issues. Environmental protection services in Benin and
other cities have improved. In 2017 the country passed a law banning the use of
plastic bags, but this has never been fully implemented. Cotonou has historically had
one of the highest levels of air pollution among West African cities due to the
widespread use of smuggled gasoline from neighboring Nigeria and, until 2016, a
regulation on the maximum quantity of sulfur permitted in fuel which allowed 3,500
parts per million (ppm) compared to 10 ppm in Europe. As in many African countries,
population growth increases the use of wood, which in turn deepens the massive
problems caused by deforestation and forest degradation. Yet under foreign pressure
and assistance, forest preservation efforts in Benin have been successful.
Carbon dioxide emissions are 0.6 tons per capita.

Benin has a very poor record in terms of education, training and research institutions.
Public spending on education increased from 2.9% of GDP in 2018 to 3.0% of GDP
in 2019 and 2020. Data on spending on research and development is not available.
The U.N. Education Index score for Benin was a comparatively low and stable 0.443
in 2020 and 2021. Basic institutions for education, training, research and
development do not function properly due to lack of support from the government.
This results in a dismal literacy rate of 42.4 %, among the worst figures in the world,
and even poor by African standards.
However, the African Development Bank (AfDB) notes significant progress with
regard to primary and secondary education in recent years. Accordingly, gross
enrollment surged to 125.6%, indicating that adults are also enrolling, and progress
has been made across the country, including in rural areas. Gender inequalities persist
(0.612 in 2019), although the female-to-male ratios in enrollment rates in secondary
education have improved (from 0.6% in 2011 to 0.7% in 2014 and 0.8 in 2020).
Although formerly known as the Latin Quarter of Africa, the AfDB assesses that the
country’s academic reputation has suffered considerably due to worsening public
university facilities. A handful of private institutes cannot compensate for a general
decline in the quality of public universities. Some improvement can be observed,
however, in the geographic spread of tertiary educational facilities. The existing
public universities in Abomey-Calavi, Parakou, Abomey and Porto-Novo have all
opened campuses in provincial towns. The government has announced important
measures to improve the higher education sector. The impacts of these measures will
be visible in the years to come.

Governance
I. Level of Difficulty
The structural constraints on governance are broad and far-reaching. The most
significant constraints are unemployment, extreme poverty, a deficient education
system, a lack of administrative as well as transport infrastructure, a critical
undersupply of energy, and a dependency on international economic developments
(cotton market, shipping and the giant neighbor Nigeria). There has been no
significant benefit from the Port of Cotonou’s ongoing reforms, which aim to take
advantage of the country’s sea access. The increasing frequency of natural disasters
such as heavy rainfalls strain the state’s resources, and structural poverty in large noncoastal areas persists.
Benin has shown great resilience in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, which
nevertheless has had some impact on economic activities. The government did not
opt for a lockdown, arguing that the country did not have the means to sustain the
economic consequences of a cessation of economic activities. As of April 13, 2023,
official statistics recorded a total of 28,014 positive cases of and 163 deaths from
COVID-19.
According to the World Bank, the short-term outlook depends on uncertainties related
to the geopolitical and security contexts, particularly in the Sahel, and to the effects
of climate change. The conflict in Ukraine has accelerated inflationary pressures,
particularly on food, and could trigger shortages and threaten food security.

Traditions of civil society in Benin are fairly strong, at least by African standards.
Even the Marxist regime of the past allowed for the operation of semi-independent
trade unions and rural development associations, and a wide variety of civic and
developmental associations have blossomed since the country came under democratic
rule. Trade unions, the Catholic Church, which has always been a significant
contributor to building political consensus in Benin, and other civil society actors
played a major role during the democratic transition of the early 1990s. Though still
highly dependent on the public face of well-known leaders and politicians,
associative activity in Benin has been undergoing formalization. Participation in
public life is valued culturally and NGOs perform an important watchdog function
vis-à-vis the government. For instance, the AfDB reports that during the 2016
elections, a platform of civil society organizations deployed 2,285 election observers.
The NGO, Social Watch, set up an initiative called PAG Citizen Watch (2016 –
Civil society
traditions

BTI 2024 | Benin 28
2021), in order to help monitor the implementation of Talon’s Government Action
Plan. During the parliamentary and municipal elections of 2019, many NGOs (e.g.,
Social Watch and WANEP) called on the president to work for inclusive elections
and have regular initiatives to promote citizen control of public action, accountability,
integrity and gender.
In a context of widespread poverty, the AfDB reports, however, that many NGOs are
highly dependent on international aid and technical support from international donors
and are vulnerable to being co-opted by political actors. Given the lack of
comprehensive survey data, levels of social capital and trust are difficult to measure,
but unlike other countries with a record of major violence, distrust is less prevalent.
The post-election political violence in Benin following the 2019 legislative elections
has broken the country’s long tradition of peace. Deadly clashes took place in
Cotonou in the neighborhood of former President Boni Yayi, in Tchaourou, Savè,
and Parakou in the north of the country, considered the political fief of the former
president. As in nearly all other African countries, Benin’s society is divided along
ethnic, regional and religious lines that shape political and social processes. The
strongest historical divide separates the northern part of the country from the south,
which historically was home to two strong kingdoms (i.e., Dahomey and PortoNovo). The conflicts between these fragmented groups have traditionally been
managed in peaceful ways; political actors trying to capitalize on ethnic or religious
sentiments use their personal proximity to the people for political gain but avoid using
incendiary language. President Yayi was frequently accused of favoritism toward
“his people” from the north. He sometimes fueled this debate with imprudent
statements. However, the north-south cleavage did not play a major role in the 2016
elections. Patrice Talon, while himself a southerner, was elected in the runoff with
the support of a broad and multiethnic coalition, which included northern politicians,
such as the minister for planning and development, Abdoulaye Bio Tchané. The
north-south rivalry has however re-emerged after the elections. In particular, Talon’s
statement, that in selecting his collaborators he will disregard regional equilibrium in
favor of competence, has been perceived by northerners as potentially discriminatory.
During the presidential elections of 2021, there was a resurgence of political violence
due to the exclusion (due to lack of sponsorship) of two candidates from President
Boni Yayi’s party. Benin faces a gradually rising threat of terrorist activity in the
north of the country, representing a spillover from violence perpetrated by Islamist
militant groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group in Burkina Faso and
Niger. Attacks are currently small and sporadic, and concentrated largely in the
border regions.

Question
Score
President Talon, who assumed office in April 2016 and was re-elected in 2021, is one
of the country’s most successful businessmen. He built his economic empire in the
port and cotton industries, the most lucrative economic sectors in Benin. Talon’s core
presidential program is articulated in the Program of Action of the Government
(PAG), made public at the end of 2016, and deals with the five-year period from 2016
to 2021. The current administration has been more consistent in attempts to
implement its Program of Actions of the Government (PAG) than previous
administrations. The plan has three main axes: consolidating democracy, the rule of
law and good governance; undertaking a structural transformation of the economy;
and improving the population’s living conditions. The plan supports the United
Nations’ 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and is intended to strengthen the
political and economic transformation. It sets a series of priorities that envisage 77
political, economic and social reforms, and 299 projects, including the reform of the
Beninese constitution, the reorganization of the cotton sector, the modernization of
the Port of Cotonou, the improvement of the education sector, and numerous other
public investments, especially in the domain energy and physical infrastructure. The
plan is however judged to be over-ambitious by many observers due to a lack of
funding. Following the re-election of Talon in 2021, a second Government Action
Program (PAG II, 2021 – 2026), was adopted with aims to expand the road network
and establish universal access to drinking water. The PAG II (2021 – 2026) has
reinstated social development as one of the three key pillars of growth. In this regard,
the new PAG identifies key strategies for enhancing the quality of human capital and
improving the welfare of the population.
In addition, a law on public-private partnership was adopted in October 2016 and a
National Development Program (PND) for 2025 was drawn up in May 2018 to
integrate a long-term vision into the actions of the PAG (2016 – 2021). The
international economic context (due to Russia’s war in Ukraine) and Benin’s
vulnerability vis-à-vis the Nigerian economy will influence the pace of
implementation of structural reforms. Some follow-up mechanisms to monitor the
execution of the five-year plan have been put in place at the national and sector level.
An inter-ministerial committee and a permanent secretary reporting to the Council of
Ministers have been established with responsibility for implementation.
Prioritization
7
BTI 2024 | Benin 30
Talon’s administration has committed to the implementation of ambitious reforms.
The PAG is based on three pillars: consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and
good governance; structural transformation of the economy; and improved social
well-being. Significant progress has been made, but several major projects such as
the reform of the partisan system had negative impacts on the democratic stability of
the country. Reforms in the agricultural sector have had a noticeable impact with
Benin being the leading producer of cotton in Africa since 2018. However, some of
the measures taken by the government in order to implement its plan of reforms seem
to have encountered opposition from workers in key sectors of the economy (e.g.,
agriculture, finance).
To achieve its second Program (PAG II, 2021 – 2026), the government plans to
mobilize $20.5 billion, with 48% to be provided by the government and 52% from
the private sector. However, the government will struggle to attract private
investment inflows as large as those envisaged under the PAG II, owing to the poor
business environment, which is marred by high levels of bureaucracy and corruption.
The government is trying to implement reforms to the business environment to attract
investment and diversify the economy. However, there are doubts about the social
consequences of privatizations. Given his background as a businessman, President
Talon is suspected of taking advantage of privatization programs for his own gain or
for the benefit of his associates. There is major progress in modernizing public
administration by digitalizing services. Benin’s e-service portal provides information
about more than 250 public services offered by public authorities. However, the
capacity of the public administration to implement reforms is weak due to a lack of
personnel and specialists. To overcome this constraint, the government has created a
number of new agencies. Petty corruption, bureaucratic delays and difficulties in
retaining the best professionals in the state administration have negatively impacted
the process of implementation of the 77 envisioned reforms. The immediate
consequence of the pandemic was a drop in corporate income, which led to a
temporary tax reduction. The same is true of the closing of the borders, which slowed
port activity.
Implementation
6
Some members of the current government were already involved in public affairs
under Yayi’s administration. Talon himself introduced the import verification reform
at the Port of Cotonou and was involved in previous efforts to reform the cotton
sector. Pascal Koupaki, secretary-general of the presidency, was prime minister under
Boni Yayi. They appear to have learned to some extent from past experiences. At the
beginning of 2016, during his election campaign, Talon made a gloomy and lucid
diagnosis of the state of the country. He compared Benin to a sick man and argued
that reforms were needed in all sectors. Talon’s presidential program represents in
several respects a break with the approach of Yayi. It proposes some innovative
reforms. However, Talon’s reformist intentions are not matched by a parallel
evolution in the everyday practices of public officials, both in the ministries and in
the local administration. The government will have to make substantial efforts to
Policy learning
6
BTI 2024 | Benin 31
encourage the administration to take ownership of the numerous reforms. To improve
the performance of the administration, working hours have been rearranged so as to
allow officials a relatively long rest period at the end of the day. To overcome the
lack of national expertise in many sectors, the Talon government has not hesitated to
call on international expertise. In February 2023, for example, a Rwandan citizen was
appointed to head the National Agency for the Identification of Persons (ANIP) to
better lead the modernization of the civil status and electoral lists.
15 | Resource Efficiency
Since taking office, the Talon government has committed to reduce state expenses by
reducing the size of the government (from 28 ministers in the last Yayi government
to 22 ministers) and eliminating several political positions in the ministerial cabinets
(e.g., attachés de cabinet and press officers). In contrast, the salaries of some cabinet
members, particularly directors of cabinet (DCs), departmental general secretaries
(SGs) and their deputies, have increased considerably. members of parliament
salaries have also risen.
Since 2016 substantial efforts have been made to reduce the budget deficit. The
budget deficit expressed as the overall balance, basis of commitments including
grants, continued to decline until 2019. It fell in 2019 to 0.5% of GDP and should
stand at 1.8% of GDP in 2020. This is likely to grow to approximately 5.1% due to
the impact of the pandemic. The government has indicated its desire to reduce this to
3% by 2022.
The government, which includes a substantial number of technocrats, has pledged to
promote merit and depoliticize the administration, by appointing high-level civil
servants through open competition. For the appointment of directors of
administration and finance in ministries, the government has established a database
of executives from which the persons to be appointed are chosen. To date, however,
this procedure is not yet operational and, in practice, there are still numerous
clientelistic and political appointments, especially for highly sought positions (e.g.,
directors of public companies). To support the creation of new prefectures, the
government has created departmental branches of several ministries. The creation of
six new prefectures has improved central state devolution and has ensured a better
coordination of public services. Formally, the country moved from six to 12
provinces (départements) several years ago, but the six new entities have never been
provided the necessary infrastructure and staff due to disputes around where the
prefectures should be located. Talon’s government appears capable of overcoming
this type of inefficiency. In January 2018, there was a merger of police and
gendarmerie personnel in order to make a more efficient use of the resources available
to these security agents. This has made a material difference to the security situation.

BTI 2024 | Benin 32
While under the Yayi government the coordination of public policies was ensured by
the Ministry of Planning and Development, the Talon government has put in place a
coordination mechanism attached to the general secretariat of the presidency of the
republic. This new body, directed by former presidential candidate Pascal Koupaki,
receives information from ministries and reports to the president. Similarly, an Office
of Analysis and Investigation (BAI, headed by Johannes Dagnon, cousin and close
friend of the president) has been created to monitor the activities of each sectoral
ministry. With this structure, the coordination of government work has become
highly centralized. It has been criticized for being administratively burdensome and
some observers contend that it unfairly limits the power of ministers. In the ministries,
the directorates for planning and forecasting are supposed to ensure the
implementation of reforms. In practice, however, there are enormous obstacles to
effective coordination, stemming in particular from competition between different
branches of the administration and between the administration and the informal
network around the president.

In principle, the struggle against corruption has been a priority of Talon’s
government. However, in practice, corruption remains a challenge. Efforts to repress
large-scale corruption are hampered by the fact that those involved often enjoy
clientelistic relationships with the incumbent regime. During Yayi’s rule, some
prominent corruption cases were publicly revealed only following pressure from
foreign donors, such as in 2014 with the embezzlement of XOF 2.6 billion (€3.96
million) from a donor-funded project to improve access to clean water and sanitation.
Talon’s government has nevertheless made an effort to fight corruption. Several highranking Beninese executives have been prosecuted, as in the Metognon-BIBE case,
in which several executives were guilty of collecting wine deposits and making a
high-risk investment of public money in a bankrupt bank. Similarly, the National
Assembly authorized the prosecution of several ministers serving President Yayi who
were accused of corruption, as well as removing the immunity of deputies accused of
corruption. The Court for the Suppression of Economic Crimes and Terrorism
(CRIET) was created in August 2018. The National Anti-Corruption Authority
(ANLC) created in 2011 was replaced in April 2020 by the High Commission for the
Prevention of Corruption. Petty corruption, involving low-ranking civil servants and
members of the security forces, as well as large-scale and national-level crimes are
investigated by the court. The replacement of the ANLC, which was an independent
body, with the High Commission for the Prevention of Corruption placed directly
under the control of the president, is considered a weakening of the capacity to fight
corruption. In fact, since its establishment, this new body has made little impact.
Hence, government measures to tackle corruption face continued challenges. Highranking politicians and civil servants are obliged by the law to disclose their assets,
but this is not respected in practice.

Although impunity remains a problem, corrupt officials are sometimes prosecuted.
For instance, the U.S. Department of State reports that, on April 7, 2022, CRIET
convicted Urbain Kanlisou, a former secretary-general of the Port Agents Union of
abuse of office and sentenced him to five years in prison and fined him XOF 100
million ($163,000) while he was still in office.
The National Directorate of Public Procurement, with branches in state ministries and
decentralized departments, is supposed to ensure the transparency of procurement
procedures. But it has not been able to eliminate corrupt practices and clientelism.
16 | Consensus-Building
There is a broad consensus among all relevant actors concerning the value of Benin’s
democratic institutions. Despite lively debates on how exactly a democratic
government should act, all actors agree that peace and democracy are the country’s
pride. All actors acknowledge the progress Benin has made since 1990 and the
necessity of further deepening democratic governance. However, several observers
believe that democracy has been weakened since President Talon’s arrival,
particularly with the adoption of new laws such as those prohibiting health and justice
workers from exercising the right to strike and reforms to the electoral code with its
restrictions on the registration of political parties for elections. The right to vote and
electoral participation have both been weakened in recent years, leading to postelection violence. Many observers believe that the political reforms initiated by
President Talon aimed to exclude certain opposition parties and political actors from
power. However, there is some hope that this is not the case, due to the participation
of the opposition in the legislative elections of January 2023. However, in the
implementation of democratic procedures, many political actors appeal to
undemocratic means such as buying votes and the use of public goods for personal
ends.
Not all major political actors agree on the goal of building a liberal market economic
system that is socially balanced. Motives vary. A segment of the population relies on
the income from illegal smuggling activities. Many political actors hesitate to support
privatization and a substantial reform of the civil service. Some entrepreneurs are not
eager to create more competition as they enjoy the benefits of near-monopolies or
oligopolies. Some politicians adhere to the French-inspired idea that crucial
industries should be in the hands of the state. At the same time, only the Communist
Party of Benin (PCB) is calling for a return to a command economy. President Patrice
Talon, who is a businessman, is in favor of a policy of privatization of state
companies. Criticized for overly liberal policies in his first term, Talon has promised
that his second term will focus on social improvements.
Consensus on goals
7
BTI 2024 | Benin 34
In 2006, defying all predictions, President Kérékou, once the main veto player, abided
by the constitution and left office. Since then, democratic actors have successfully
and permanently co-opted all veto actors. In the period under review, no openly antidemocratic actors have emerged. Despite accusations from the opposition of having
authoritarian aspirations, Boni Yayi, like Kérékou, kept his commitment to leave
office after two mandates. The military, a highly influential veto player throughout
the country’s history, has apparently developed a more republican spirit and stays out
of politics.
However, President Patrice Talon’s commitment to respecting democratic principles
is not certain. Although Talon has stated he will not seek re-election in 2026, the
erosion of democratic norms under his rule may presage a bid for a third term in
office. In other words, recent political violence and prosecutions, a parliament
comprised exclusively of one party, limitations on freedom of the press, legal actions
targeting the political opposition, regular attacks from armed groups in northern
border regions and the potential of spillover effects from jihadist movements in
neighboring countries all underline the potentially fragile democratic consensus.
Another threat may emerge from the rise of piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, including
in Benin’s waters. The IMB’s Piracy Reporting Center recorded 84 attempted and
successful attacks in 2020, up from 64 in 2019 (and 82 in 2018). Most attacks were
kidnapping attempts (of the crew for ransom). The region is now the location of over
90% of the world’s reported kidnappings at sea.

In stark contrast to neighboring countries, national unity is not an empty phrase in
Benin. Credit for this success is attributable to the overall policy of all governments
since 1990 and the country’s political culture. During the second term of the Yayi
presidency, however, the polarization between supporters and opponents of the
president increased, taking on, at least in part, an ethnoregional character. When
government critics who believed Yayi intended to stay in power beyond 2016 began
to protest, government supporters immediately responded by organizing White
Friday marches, instead of opening a peaceful dialogue with the opposition. Yayi’s
withdrawal from politics at the end of his presidential term and the election of a new
president led to a temporary depolarization of the political environment. However,
recent reforms to the party system and the constitutional revision, adopted by force,
have plunged Benin into a deep political crisis. To resolve the post-election crisis of
2019, President Talon convened a political dialogue in October 2019 that resulted in
the release of several political detainees and the participation of some parts of the
opposition in the municipal elections of May 2020. However, the president is
perceived by some supporters of Yayi as being unfavorable to northern citizens and
his public commitment to privilege competence over regional equilibrium in political
appointments is viewed with suspicion. Since his election, Talon has replaced many
Yayi loyalists at the upper levels of the administration with people who supported
him in the first round of elections, a practice perceived by other political groups as
divisive.

BTI 2024 | Benin 35
Benin’s executive has rarely felt the need to consult civil society organizations. This
seems to be even more the case under President Talon’s administration. However, the
decentralization law allows for citizen participation in local governance and CSOs
have used this to introduce citizen voices into the drafting of budgets and of
development plans in several locations (not without some resistance from time to
time). In addition, since the end of the 1990s, the parliament has consulted major
CSOs (including trade unions) during budgetary sessions, asking for their input.
Finally, it is common for the standing committees in parliament tasked with
reviewing specific bills to consult with civil society organizations active in relevant
domains.
Overall, however, there are few institutional mechanisms for the systematic
accommodation of civil society interests within the government’s policymaking
process. It is a widely held view in Benin that civil society activists are appointed to
cabinet as a means of co-opting them and quelling their criticism. Regardless of the
motives for their appointment to cabinet, their presence suggests an acknowledgment
in government of the need to give civil society actors careful consideration.
While support from civil society organizations, in particular Citizen Alternative, was
an important factor behind Talon’s election as president, Talon’s election has
inaugurated a new period of co-optation of prominent civil society leaders, who now
occupy positions in the government (e.g., Citizen Alternative leader Joseph
Djogbénou was justice minister and president of the Constitutional Court until July
2022) and in the National Assembly (e.g., longtime civil society militant Orden
Alladatin is now a member of parliament). This potentially weakens the capacity of
civil society to perform a watchdog role. Communication with the rest of civil society
does not seem a priority for Talon, who, in contrast to Boni Yayi, is known to be
secretive and dislikes contact with the public.
Public
consultation
5
Although systematic torture was employed under the first Mathieu Kérékou regime,
no relevant political actor in the country has expressed a desire for large-scale
reconciliation. Victims of torture are recognized, however, and they are eligible to
receive a small pension. The National Conference in February 1990 successfully
brought an end to Benin’s authoritarian period of history. Kérékou was forced to
resign from office and was granted amnesty for acts committed during his rule. After
the post-election violence of 2019, President Talon initiated a political dialogue that
began in October 2020. Several political parties from the opposition and the protest
movement participated. At the conclusion of the dialogue, political actors of all
stripes established a consensus around 18 key recommendations, the gradual
implementation of which should help thaw the political crisis. However, this dialogue
did not preserve the country from electoral violence in 2019 and 2021. The current
situation seems calm with the participation of opposition parties in the most recent
elections. However, in the aftermath of previous electoral violence and numerous
cases of exile and imprisonment of opponents, many are calling for the government
to initiate some kind of reconciliation process. Recently, the opposition party, Les
Démocrates, and some political activists have suggested adopting an amnesty law.

BTI 2024 | Benin 36
17 | International Cooperation
Given its dependence on foreign assistance, Benin has limited agency over accepting
or refusing international aid. Development partners have faith in Benin’s attempts to
advance the consolidation of democracy but are increasingly alienated by the
prevalence of corruption and mismanagement in the state administration. As a poor
country without substantial natural resources, Benin has very little negotiation power
vis-à-vis its international partners. This means that, although the government has
nominally relative discretion on the allocation of aid, which is to a large extent
disbursed as budget support, international partners are able to strongly influence the
country’s policies and priorities. Benin’s historical prioritization of macroeconomic
stability over other socioeconomic goals can be seen at least in part as a response to
external concerns. Moreover, under pressure from international donors, the Beninese
leadership frequently tends to initiate programs without a serious commitment to
effective implementation. Benin is trying to diversify its international relations, but,
in spite of important trade links with China, India and Thailand, Western countries
remain Benin’s most significant partners.
The Economist Intelligence Unit reports that Benin will continue to prioritize ties
with foreign donors and bilateral lenders in 2023/2024, a period during which the
extended fund facility and extended credit facility (EFF/ECF) arrangement with the
IMF will provide the country with budgetary and policy support. In March 2023,
France reaffirmed its commitment to boosting economic, security, educational and
cultural ties with Benin.
Effective use of
support

Having honored its international commitments, the government is generally
considered a credible and stable partner by foreign governments, international
organizations and the NGO community. Benin cooperates willingly with the United
Nations and the International Court of Justice. On the other hand, following several
declarations made against the government by the African Court on Human and
Peoples’ Rights (CADHP), the country decided to withdraw from the African Court
of Human Rights. Benin no longer allows its citizens and civil society organizations
in the country to appeal to this African jurisdiction in the event of a violation of their
rights.
Benin also continues to contribute a significant part of its military to U.N. peace
operations. However, the country’s reliability suffers from delayed policy
implementation, occasionally for opaque reasons. The IMF strongly criticized the
management of public finances and the opaque award of public tenders during the
last period of the Yayi administration. However, the Talon administration seems to
have regained the IMF’s confidence. Major donors continue to support Benin. Benin
will continue to prioritize ties with foreign donors and bilateral lenders. In July 2022,
a total of $638 million was approved by the IMF as part of the extended credit facility
(ECF) and extended fund facility (EFF). In July 2022, France announced plans for

closer collaboration with Benin through additional investments in security, education
and culture. France currently supports Benin with military intelligence and training
to counter the jihadist threat along its borders. The United States began in September
2015 a second Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) compact (2015 – 2020) with
Benin, amounting to approximately $375 million for power supply and economic
growth.
In December 2022, the Millennium Challenge Corporation granted a regional
transport compact (BENIN-NIGER), devoting $504 million to improve the trade
corridor between the port of Cotonou in Benin and the capital city of Niamey, Niger.
In 2016, the European Union and the Beninese government signed a five-year Good
Governance and Development Contract for €114 million, of which €103 million will
be disbursed as budget support. The European Union insists that its aid should be
spent on improving the transparency of public finances, anti-corruption initiatives
and reinforcing the rule of law. Inconsistencies in regulation and law enforcement
and a voiceless parliament make Benin a challenging investment partner. Economic
cooperation with other southern hemisphere countries is less hampered by these kinds
of challenges than it is with Benin.
Benin has been a strong supporter of the regional WAEMU convergence schemes
and fulfills the required four primary criteria of the planned West African Economic
Union. Due to its limited economic and political weight, Benin cannot become a
driving force behind increased integration. It strongly supports both ECOWAS and
the AU, but, as a small country, Benin is certainly much less influential than players
like Nigeria or South Africa. The country has a good record of the peaceful resolution
of border conflicts. Border disputes with Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria were
peacefully settled by international bodies like ECOWAS or the International Court
of Justice, or, if still unsettled, do not pose a major threat to bilateral relations.
Benin’s relations with its West African neighbors will be reinforced by their joint
need to combat the twin threats of piracy and Islamist militant groups, and by the
country’s participation in ECOWAS-led integration efforts. However, tensions with
neighboring Nigeria over cross-border smuggling (particularly fuel from Nigeria,
with the heavily subsidized price creating arbitrage opportunities) will persist.

Strategic Outlook
Since coming into power in April 2016, President Talon has faced controversy. He was re-elected
in 2021 amidst controversial presidential elections. Electoral reforms introduced in 2019 during
his first term prevented key opposition politicians from participating. However, in January 2023,
following a decision by the Constitutional Court in November 2022, the opposition took part in
legislative elections and secured 28 out of 109 seats in parliament. The loyal parties UP and BR,
supportive of the president, still retain the majority. This means that Talon’s ongoing reforms are
likely to continue until 2026, when he is expected to step down after completing two terms. The
increased presence of the opposition provides more space for channeling social discontent
regarding Talon’s increasingly authoritarian rule. Benin still needs policies to bring it back in line
with inclusive democratic standards. A national dialogue is necessary to address political stability.
Maintaining political stability is crucial for preserving the impressive economic growth Benin has
experienced in recent years. The government will continue to focus on improving economic
growth Policy support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other donors can assist
Benin in managing the economic impact of external shocks, including the surge in global food and
oil prices due to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Revenue mobilization is a key aspect of Benin’s reform
program. An effective fight against corruption is necessary to sustain this. The government has
also implemented reforms to improve the business environment and attract investment, aiming to
diversify the economy. Ongoing public investments in infrastructure, particularly in transportation
and energy projects under the PAG II, will drive industrial growth. Construction of an oil pipeline
from Niger’s Agadem Basin to Benin’s Port Seme, scheduled for completion in July 2023,
development of the GloDjigbé special economic zone and expansion of Cotonou port will further
support economic growth. The government aims to achieve sustainable economic growth while
addressing social welfare goals.
Security remains a significant challenge for Benin. The country faces a gradually increasing threat
of terrorist activity in the north, originating from Islamist militant groups affiliated with al-Qaida
and the Islamic State group in Burkina Faso and Niger. Currently, the attacks are small and
sporadic, primarily concentrated in border regions. The likelihood of armed Islamist groups
gaining control over large parts of the country is slim. However, there is a real risk of the state
losing control over remote and marginalized areas, where, due to limited state influence, militants
could exploit conflicts between farming and herding communities. Strengthening military
partnerships, enhancing regional and international security cooperation and providing support will
be crucial to addressing these challenges.
